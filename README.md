#### Regular Game loop: 
1. GM spawns a random creature with a rarity and stats
2. first player to use battle command fights it
3. fight is carried out automatically, both parties take turns in attacking each-other, first attacker is a coin toss
4. if the player wins, they get the monster's soul (may boost stats or provide special effects when equipped in its respective phylactery)
5. new creature is spawned once the timer is elapsed(60 minutes to start)
6. every day a boss is spawned that has a grace period of 20 minutes where multiple players can use the battle command to join the fight
7. the boss fight works like a regular creature fight, all players are considered a single entity so their turn is executed all at once
8. when the boss dies, every player gets a soul of a high rarity
9. Upon player death, they get revived once 30 minutes are elapsed
10. souls you are not using can be broken down into shards and then spent on phylacteries , a random different soul, reviving etc.
11. inventory management is done by DM-ing the GM bot so the battle channel isn't spammed
